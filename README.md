 ## Setup

 This is a Xamarin.Forms app. Visual Studio is needed to run it, but setup should be minimal. If you don't have Xamarin.forms installed there is a installation guide [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/get-started/installation/?pivots=macos).
 
  After installing Xamarin and forking/cloning the repository selecting SampleApp.sln (located in the SampleApp folder) should load the project. 

## Running

  If you intend to use an android emulator the setup guide can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/android/get-started/installation/android-emulator/) . I developed this specifically targeting an android emulator, although an iOS emulator should work as well(Image selection may not work on iOS). Here is a link that shows how to deploy to an iPhone [wirelessly](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/ios/deploy-test/wireless-deployment?tabs=macos). [Here's](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/ios/deploy-test/debugging-in-xamarin-ios?tabs=macos) another page about debugging on mac that may be helpful with running the project
